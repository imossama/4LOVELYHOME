#### Overview üåü

This project is a web application that allows users to control and manage their devices connected to a local home WiFi network remotely. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing various smart home devices such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras.

#### Features ‚ú®

- **Device Discovery** üîç: Automatically discover devices connected to the local network.
- **Remote Control** üì°: Control devices from anywhere using the web application.
- **Real-time Updates** ‚è±Ô∏è: Get real-time status updates from devices.
- **User Authentication** üîê: Secure login and authentication for users.
- **Responsive Design** üì±üíª: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Device Management** ‚öôÔ∏è: Add, remove, and configure devices.

#### Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Frontend**: Next.js with Node.js
- **Backend**: C++
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Communication Protocol**: MQTT
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Hosting**: AWS EC2 for backend, AWS S3 for frontend

#### System Architecture üèóÔ∏è

##### 1. Frontend
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated applications.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

##### 2. Backend
- **C++**: A high-level programming language.
- **Crow/Pistache**: Web frameworks for C++ to handle HTTP requests.

##### 3. Database
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user information, device states, and logs.

##### 4. Device Communication
- **MQTT**: A lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices, optimized for high-latency or unreliable networks.

##### 5. Security
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
- **HTTPS**: Secure communication using SSL/TLS.

#### Implementation Steps üìù

##### Backend with C++

1. **Set Up C++ Environment**:
   - Install necessary C++ compilers (like GCC or Clang).
   - Choose a C++ web framework (Crow, Pistache, or similar).

2. **Create the Backend API**:
   - Define your API endpoints (e.g., device control, status updates, user authentication).
   - Implement the endpoints using your chosen C++ framework.

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Use a MongoDB C++ driver (e.g., `mongo-cxx-driver`) to interact with your MongoDB database.

4. **MQTT Communication**:
   - Integrate an MQTT client library for C++ (like `mosquitto`) to handle device communication.

##### Frontend with Next.js and Node.js

1. **Set Up Next.js Project**:
   - Initialize a new Next.js project using `create-next-app`.
   - Set up the project structure with pages, components, and styles.

2. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Use JWT for user authentication.
   - Create login and registration pages.

3. **API Routes in Next.js**:
   - Use Next.js API routes for any server-side logic that can be handled within Node.js.

4. **Device Control and Management**:
   - Create pages and components for device discovery, control, and management.
   - Use Axios to make API calls to the C++ backend.

#### Deployment üöÄ

1. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Build the Next.js application for production.
   - Deploy the static files to AWS S3.

2. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Compile the C++ backend for your target environment.
   - Deploy the backend service to an AWS EC2 instance.

#### Additional Considerations üìå

- **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
- **CI/CD**: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for your services to track performance and errors.
